Dinner Dash is an online restaurant marketplace built with Ruby on Rails.

This was a two week project at the Turing School of Software Development and Design. Our first Rails application.  Our team paired for
a majority of the project.  I focused on the implementation of the CRUD functionality of items, and role based authorization.

Team consisted of Mac McCarthy, Kyra Steenbock, and Markus Olsen.
